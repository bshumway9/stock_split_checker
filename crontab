# Run stock split checker every weekday at 8:00 AM EST
# To change the time, modify the first two numbers:
# Format: minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week
# Examples:
# 0 8 * * 1-5   = 8:00 AM weekdays (current)
# 30 7 * * 1-5  = 7:30 AM weekdays  
# 0 14 * * 1-5  = 8:00 AM weekdays (14:00 in 24-hour format) (THIS IS THE ONLY CORRECT LINE FOR MST)
# 15 6 * * 1-5  = 6:15 AM weekdays
0 14 * * 1-5 cd /app && /usr/local/bin/python reverse_split_checker.py >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1

# Empty line required at end of crontab file

@reboot sleep 30 && cd /app && /usr/local/bin/python check_missed_run.py >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
